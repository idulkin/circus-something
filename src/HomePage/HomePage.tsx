            We find ourselves back yet again, on the winter solstice celebrating
            the beauty of the night. But what happens to the light when things
            get dark? On the longest night of the year, Circus Something
            sacrifices the light and explores the complexities of darkness with
            new and returning performances from The Slither Sirens, The Vampire
            Vixen of The Bay, The Grim Theatre, and many more!

            What if the light was not what you thought it was? Light sparkles
            and shines, burns and blinds. Light can be beautiful and misleading.
            White is not always good, honest, and innocent. Bright is not always
            warm and welcoming.
